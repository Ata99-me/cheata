            <h4>
                If you're curious about my birthday, it is 22/02/2006. 
                My birthplace is an island called Koh Sdach which means
                King Island in English. Sadly, there's no king there.
                Koh Sdach features a long beach, and the sea is filled with a variety
                of fish. The site is excellent for snorkeling or scuba diving,
                as the water is clear, and an array of coral can be seen 
                growing at the bottom of the sea. 
            </h4>

            <h4>
                According to legend, there once was a king who commanded 
                an army on the island. Because there was no fresh water, 
                the king searched everywhere to find some. At last he found 
                a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might contain water, 
                the king drew his sword and split open the rock, releasing 
                an endless flow of water that local people still use today.
                (I'm not lying.) Even if the weather is as hot as hell, the water
                won't be running out. Today, rock become a well(not a concrete well).
                If you go to see the well, you are going to see some horses'
                footprint on the well(rock). You will also see some swrod scar on the 
                well and we legend beleivers said that it's the scar where the
                king slpit up the rock.
            </h4>
            
            <h4>
                Koh Sdach is located in the Gulf of Thailand, around 1.5km off 
                the coast of Botum Sakor national park, in the Kiri Sakor district 
                in Koh Kong province, Cambodia. It belongs to a small archipelago 
                of 12 islands, all in relative proximity to each other and to the 
                main land. A fishing community inhabits the island, with people 
                of Khmer, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese descent. The village 
                stretches along the east side of the island; to the west there is 
                a small Khmer run bungalow guesthouse; at the southern end of the 
                island lies a luxurious holiday resort. Koh Sdach has two beaches, 
                one to the south and one westerly facing.

                My Hobby is the three pictures above. If I have so much freetime, 
                I would read manga while listening to music. At night, I would watch
                anime until the roosters crow, but I can't do this in Liger or else 
                ...-I think you know what I'm thinking. Sometimes, I would go biking
                around on the island. I live close to the beach, so sometimes, I would
                biking for swimming with the little fishes that I'm scared of (the most?).
                I also have a one year old baby brother. When mom is busy, sometimes, I would
                just babysit him. Jeff says that he really like to baby Henry because he can
                spend time with his son. It's true that you got to spend time with your son or brother
                , but I don't really like babysitting. I feeling it's killing me and that's reminds me of 
                my mom and how tired she must be.

                How do I say this? My hobby at school? Assignments? In my freetimes, 
                I would do laundry as fast as passible or else I don't have anymore time 
                to get my clothes washed. As juniors, we wash our clothes...traditionally?
                We don't have a machine like senior and when we ask why, people were like
                "That's a part of your life. Nothing is always easy"...blah and blah. 
                One thing that we never miss is assigments. In the first few weeks of school, 
                there's only one or two, but as days go on, we got more and more. It's rarely
                me to have nothing to do at all in liger. When that time comes, I call home 
                and see how's eveybody doing. Then, I would read comic online or watch anime 
                on different website. On the weekend, our housemate would sit and watch TV 
                together and it was the happiest time (although not as happy as watching anime).
                That's how I spend my life at school.

                Khmer class is one of the classes that gives us

                how I love it. Math class has become one of my 
                favorites because it doesn’t require that much of memorization.

            people's stuff on my desk, but what I hate the most is seeing people leaving.
            Everybody tells me that nobody is going to be by your side forver. I know, 
            but I just don't want it to be happening because it hurts. I also hate
            the fact that people lie to each other just to catch other's attention.
            Although, I dislike many things, I also have many things to be liked.

            Although, he is very annoyed sometimes, I still love him and I want to be loved 
            by him too. There is no reason to love people. I love them because I want to.
